    "description": "The factory aims to optimize production within the constraints of a maximum of \\param{MaxProductionHours} hours and a labor cost not exceeding \\param{LaborCostLimit} dollars. There are \\param{NumProducts} products, each with specific labor costs \\param{LaborCostPerProduct}, production times \\param{ProductionTimePerProduct}, and profit margins \\param{ProfitPerProduct}. The production targets for each product are at least \\param{MinProductionGoal} units. The objective is to maximize the total profit while adhering to time and cost restrictions."
